export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a passionate full stack developer with a strong focus on creating robust and efficient web and mobile applications. During my participation in the Full-Stack Web Developer Program at Ironhack (October 2023 - May 2024), I gained solid experience in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside frameworks like React. I also developed back-end skills with Node.js and Express.js, and worked with databases like MongoDB.

Ironhack allowed me to work on both individual and team projects, where I enhanced my problem-solving and collaboration skills. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by learning Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, applying full stack principles to deliver innovative and high-quality solutions.`;
